#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

#![warn(missing_docs)]

#![warn(missing_debug_implementations)]
#![warn(missing_copy_implementations)]

#![warn(box_pointers)]

Use clippy plugin: https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy
Add to Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
clippy = "*"

Add to your .rs file:
#![feature(plugin)]
#![plugin(clippy)]

#![deny(clippy)]  //this should work! but doesn't currently!
#![deny(shadow_unrelated)] //this shouldn't be needed if the above works!
